A basic project to create a weather reporter to read me the weather in the morning. Using OpenWeather API key

Working on the Rust file.
An if else setup might make more sense than the match case setup.

look into how to use match vs if else
    mainly see if the match will allow you to just modify the string rather than return it to temp
        I believe it currently acts as a way to modify the matching variable rather than execute a block of code
